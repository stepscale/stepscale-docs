A lightweight solution for collecting and aggregating custom metrics for scaling decisions beyond standard AWS metrics.

### Predictive Scaler (Coming Q4 2025)

An advanced scaling solution that uses machine learning to predict scaling needs before they occur, reducing both costs and scaling delays.

### Cross-Region Scaler (Coming 2026)

A global scaling solution that optimizes workload distribution across multiple AWS regions for improved availability and cost efficiency.
