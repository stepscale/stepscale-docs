# About StepScale.io

## Our Mission

At StepScale.io, we're focused on solving the complex challenges of cloud resource scaling. We believe that efficient scaling is a cornerstone of both cost optimization and system reliability, and we're committed to building tools that make this accessible to organizations of all sizes.

## Our Approach

We take a different approach to scaling challenges:

1. **Modular by Design**: Our solutions are built with modularity at their core, making them adaptable to diverse environments
2. **Open Source First**: We believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and adoption
3. **Data-Driven**: Our scaling algorithms are based on real-world data and practical experience
4. **Simplicity**: We focus on making complex scaling decisions simple and transparent

## Our Team

StepScale.io brings together experts in cloud infrastructure, software engineering, and DevOps practices. Our team has experience building and running large-scale distributed systems across various industries.

## Open Source Commitment

We're committed to open source development. Our Fast Autoscaler project is just the beginning of our contributions to the community. We believe that by sharing our tools and knowledge, we can help advance the state of cloud infrastructure management for everyone.
