# Technical Articles

Welcome to our collection of technical articles. Here, you'll find in-depth discussions, tutorials, and best practice guides related to cloud infrastructure, AWS services, and container orchestration.

Our articles aim to provide practical insights drawn from real-world experience implementing cloud-native scaling solutions.

## Featured Articles

### [Why Choose Fargate + AWS Autoscaling Instead of EKS with EC2?](/docs/articles/why-fargate-instead-of-eks-ec2)
